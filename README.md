# Portfolio Projects â€“ Qinwen Tang

This repository showcases a selection of my technical and game development projects built using Unity, C++, Python, and web tools. Most of these projects were created as part of my coursework or capstone projects at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), or through personal exploration and experimentation.

## Intervitae: Intuition Institution
**Role:** Systems & Interaction Programmer  
**Tech Stack:** Unity, C#
Narrative detective game about intuition, legacy, and uncovering hidden truths. As the systems programmer, I implemented the interactive evidence system, integrated gameplay with dialogue, and collaborated with the team to deliver a smooth narrativeâ€“gameplay experience.

**Key responsibilities:**
  - Built the evidence class structure and logic to support drag-and-drop interactions and conditional linking
  - Synchronized evidence events with branching dialogue sequences using custom triggers
  - Integrated animations and visual feedback to guide players through investigative steps
  - Collaborated with writers and artists to ensure gameplayâ€“narrative coherence
  - Localized the entire game UI and content into simplified Chinese for game festival submission

## Tie the Knot
**Role:** Gameplay Programmer  
**Tech Stack:** Unity, C#  
Puzzle game where players tie specific soul-representing knots on a grid. I implemented the core rope interaction and tutorial systems, including:
  - Drawing knots using Unity's Line Renderer
  - Pin interaction logic (click, right-click, delete, reset)
  - Interactive tutorial sequence to teach mechanics and controls

## RPI Internet Monitor
**Role:** Front-End Developer  
**Tech Stack:** React.js, Mapbox  
An interactive web app for visualizing WiFi signal strength across campus. I handled front-end components, integrated Mapbox with React, and proposed an OOP-based modular UI structure.

## Computer Vision Assignments
**Role:** Student Developer  
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV  
A collection of assignments from the CSCI 4270 Computer Vision course at RPI. Tasks involved building end-to-end pipelines for image classification, feature detection, and difference analysis.

**Key topics:**
  - Image difference detection and frame comparison  
  - Feature extraction using OpenCV (edges, contours, histograms)  
  - Training simple convolutional neural networks for classification  
  - Histogram matching and intensity transformations

## Accessible Campus Routes
**Role:** Project Developer
**Tech Stack:** Web / Mapping Stack
A student-led project aimed at providing accessible navigation tools on campus. I built the early framework for a map-based application and supported UI design for future route data integration.

## Other Demos & Prototypes
**Unwrap RPI**  
A contemplative game about retracing the musical history of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Players use historical artifacts and melody-based placement puzzles to uncover personal and institutional memories.
