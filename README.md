# Portfolio Projects – Qinwen Tang

This repository showcases a selection of my technical and game development projects built using Unity, C++, Python, and web tools. Most of these projects were created as part of my coursework or capstone projects at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), or through personal exploration and experimentation.
